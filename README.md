# Raycast Engines in Python

A collection of raycasting engines implemented in Python, ranging from simple to advanced implementations with various optimizations and effects.

## Features

- Multiple raycasting implementations with different performance characteristics
- Hardware acceleration support
- Trippy visual effects
- Non-Euclidean map support
- Optimized for performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame
- NumPy (for some implementations)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements:
